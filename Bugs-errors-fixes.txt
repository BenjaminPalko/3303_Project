BUG - Server printing 'waiting' and 'invalid input' on start up

MINOR - When inputting numbers, giving n number of zero's before a valid input will work

MINOR - No 'invalid input' given when giving non boolean answer to a boolean query, 
either have all invalid inputs handled this way or give 'invalid input' notification
also keep notifications consistant

MINOR - Spaces before input will give invalid input

ERROR - When file is not found in WWR mode program crashes with NoSuchFileException,
change to deal with error gracefully

BUG IMPORTANT - When 'file not found' for RRQ is executed, on second execution will 
cause the program to be stuck in an infinite loop after 'sending' NOTE: Second
execution can be either RRQ or WRQ, calling quit(4) will also cause the program
to become unresponsive
